1. Simulates Environmental Factors:
       * Thermal Dynamics (`ThermalModel`): It calculates temperature changes based on heat generated by a cpu_load and the efficiency of a cooling system. This model
         applies principles similar to Newton's Law of Cooling, considering air mass, heat capacity, and heat/cooling coefficients.
       * Airflow Dynamics (`AirflowModel`): It models the flow of air, taking into account a nominal flow rate and potential obstructions. This affects how heat and
         humidity might be distributed or removed from the environment.
       * Humidity Changes (`HumidityModel`): It simulates humidity levels, incorporating a natural drift and random fluctuations (noise) to represent realistic
         environmental variations.


   2. Integrates Models (`EnvironmentalModel`): A central EnvironmentalModel orchestrates the individual thermal, airflow, and humidity models. It advances all these
      sub-models by one time step, consolidating their outputs into a single, comprehensive environmental state (temperature, humidity, airflow).


   3. Represents a Virtual Entity (`VirtualNode`): The VirtualNode acts as the primary entity being simulated (e.g., a server, a rack, or a room). It generates an
      internal cpu_load (representing activity or work being done), which then feeds into the EnvironmentalModel to influence the environmental conditions.


   4. Generates Telemetry: At each step of the simulation, the VirtualNode collects and provides telemetry data, including its node_id, a timestamp, the calculated
      temperature, humidity, airflow, and the cpu_load that was applied.


  In essence, the physics engine creates a virtual representation of an environment, allowing for the study and prediction of how various physical parameters interact
  and evolve, particularly useful for understanding and optimizing systems like HVAC in data centers or smart buildings.
